# Phoenix LiveView

A summary for Phoenix and Phoenix LiveView.

## Phoenix

### Flow CRC pattern

Phoenix follows the pattern **CRC** (Constructors Reducers and Converters). This is a representation of this pattern:

```elixir
connection_from_request
|> endpoint
|> router
|> custom_application
```
* The **endpoint** has a couple of configurations and Plug where the router is the last one.
* The **router** connect a request to the module that will process it and set policies (how a request should be managed), e.x.: accept only `JSON` for `:api` requests.
* The **custom_application** can be a Phoenix controller, a Phoenix channels application, or a live view.

### Plug.Conn

Plugs == reducers, they take a Plug.Conn as he first param and returns a Plug.Conn.

#### Migration (core part)

The migration file defines a database table, products , along with a set of fields for that table.
**IMPORTANT** Always take a look at generated file because some times it doesn't do what we need.

#### Schema (core part)

Think of schemas as maps between two kinds of data.
On the database side is the `products` table we generated with our migration.
On the Elixir side, the `Product` schema knows how to translate between
the `products` database table and the `Pento.Catalog.Product` Elixir struct.

### Context

A Phoenix Context is a module in your Phoenix application that provides an API for a service or resource.
It is responsible for managing uncertainty, external interfaces, and process machinery.

**Developer tip**: use **with** instead of **pipes** because is easier to control errors with **with**.

* Sample:
```elixir
# pipes
def send_sale_skus(query) do
query
|> Product.cheap_product_skus(25.00)
|> run_query
|> Service.send_bargains
end

# with

```

## LiveView

### LiveView Flow

Router => liveview.mount/3 => liveview.render/2

### Generate a LiveView

Weâ€™ll construct the generator command such that it will generate a Catalog context with a schema for Product, corresponding to a products database table. A product will have name , description , unit_price , and SKU fields, like this:

```bash
mix phx.gen.live Catalog Product products name:string description:string unit_price:float sku:integer:unique
```
