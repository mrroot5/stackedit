# Phoenix LiveView

A summary for Phoenix and Phoenix LiveView.

## Phoenix

### Flow CRC pattern

Phoenix follows the pattern **CRC** (Constructors Reducers and Converters). This is a representation of this pattern:

```elixir
connection_from_request
|> endpoint
|> router
|> custom_application
```
* The **endpoint** has a couple of configurations and Plug where the router is the last one.
* The **router** connect a request to the module that will process it and set policies (how a request should be managed), e.x.: accept only `JSON` for `:api` requests.
* The **custom_application** can be a Phoenix controller, a Phoenix channels application, or a live view.

### Plug.Conn

Plugs == reducers, they take a Plug.Conn as he first param and returns a Plug.Conn.

### Context

A Phoenix Context is a module in your Phoenix application that provides an API for a service or resource.
It is responsible for managing uncertainty, external interfaces, and process machinery.

## LiveView

### LiveView Flow

Router => liveview.mount/3 => liveview.render/2

### Generate a LiveView

Weâ€™ll construct the generator command such that it will generate a Catalog context with a schema for Product , corresponding to a products database table.
A product will have name , description , unit_price , and SKU fields, like this

`mix phx.gen.live Catalog Product products name:string description:string unit_price:float sku:integer:unique`
